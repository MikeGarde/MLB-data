### Work in progress

I will continue to post new Jupyter Notebooks as I write them.

# Tool for aggregating MLB data

Please note the data this tool collects is [copyrighted by MLBAM](http://gdx.mlb.com/components/copyright.txt)
and cannot be used for commercial purposes.

The [MLB API](https://appac.github.io/mlb-data-api-docs/) is very useful but somewhat sloppy. This tool
aims to make their data available to you and me but in a usable format.

## Using the Tool

You will need to use [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/) to run these Python scripts. I suggest trying
out [Anaconda Navigator](https://anaconda.org/).

Simply open the notebook and hit run.

## Script Specifics

* General Team Data
    * Requires A [Google API Key](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
    and access to the [Google Geocode API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/geocoding-backend.googleapis.com?q=geocode)
